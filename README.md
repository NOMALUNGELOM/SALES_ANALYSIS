# SALES_ANALYSIS

# 1. Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a simulated dataset providing daily trading information for a single retail product. The primary goal is to develop key performance metrics, interpret trends visualized in a dashboard, and provide actionable business recommendations.

# 2. Data Source
- Dataset: Sales Case Study.csv (Simulated dataset)
- Scope: Daily aggregated trading information for one product.
- Key Fields: Date, Sales (Rand value), Cost of Sales (Rand value), Quantity Sold.

# 3. Objective and Required Metrics
- The core objective is to derive subsequent insights from the data. The following specific metrics were developed and analyzed:
- Daily sales price per unit.
- Average unit sales price of the product.
- Daily percentage gross profit.
- Daily percentage gross profit per unit.
- Price Elasticity of Demand during specific promotional periods.
- Additional insights, visuals, reports, dashboards, and KPIs.
  
# 4.Insights and Analysis (Dashboard Summary)
The analysis was visualized in a performance overview dashboard, revealing critical insights into the product's financial health.
Metric	Value	Observation
Total Sales	187M	High sales volume achieved.
Total Gross Profit	-7.12M	Critical negative profitability.

# Key Findings:
- Systemic Profitability Issues: The dashboard confirmed that negative gross profit is a frequent, daily occurrence, not an isolated event.
- Ineffective Pricing Strategy: There is little to no correlation between the unit price and the resulting gross profit margin. High-priced items frequently yield negative margins.
- Reliance on Promotions: Sales have declined year-over-year (2014-2016). A heavy reliance on promotions to drive sales volume appears to be eroding overall profitability.
# 5. Recommendations
The following strategic recommendations address the critical negative gross profit issue:
# Short-Term Actions
- Immediate Cost Review: Audit product acquisition and operational costs to identify margin leakage.
- Revise Pricing Model: Implement a pricing strategy that ensures a minimum profitable margin is maintained, even during sales periods.
- Investigate Loss Drivers: Analyze specific product SKUs and time periods contributing most heavily to the R7.12M loss.
# Long-Term Actions
- Optimize Promotional Strategy: Shift from blanket discounts to targeted, profitable promotions.
- Portfolio Management: Discontinue products that consistently underperform financially.
